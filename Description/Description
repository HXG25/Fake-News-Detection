Fake News Detection System

This project is a Fake News Detection System that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify news articles as real or fake. 
With the rise of misinformation online, this system aims to assist users, platforms, and organizations in identifying unreliable news content.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze textual news data to identify patterns in fake and real news.
Build a predictive model to automatically classify news articles.
Help reduce the spread of misinformation and improve content credibility.


📊 Dataset
The dataset contains:
News headlines
Full text of news articles
Labels: Fake or Real
(Example: Kaggle’s Fake News Dataset or LIAR dataset)


🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Depending on your implementation:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Deep Learning: LSTM / Transformer-based models (optional)


Model evaluation metrics:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
ROC-AUC Score
